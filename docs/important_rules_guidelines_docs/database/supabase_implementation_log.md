# Supabase Implementation Log - AromaChat Essential Oil Management

**Project:** AromaChat
**Database:** Supabase Project 'aromachat' (ID: iutxzpzbznbgpkdwbzds)
**Region:** sa-east-1
**Status:** ACTIVE_HEALTHY
**Last Updated:** May 12, 2025

## Current Implementation Status

We have successfully confirmed that the Supabase 'aromachat' project exists and is active. Most of the required database tables have already been created according to the schema provided in `database_schema.md`. We have now implemented key missing components including role-based access control, triggers, and RLS policies.

### Completed Tasks

- âœ“ Confirmed access to Supabase 'aromachat' project
- âœ“ Verified uuid-ossp extension is installed
- âœ“ Main essential oils table and all required lookup tables exist
- âœ“ Junction tables linking essential oils to their properties exist
- âœ“ Added role and subscription fields to profiles table
- âœ“ Implemented names_concatenated trigger for essential_oils table
- âœ“ Configured RLS policies for all tables (read for all, write for admins only)

### Tables Status

1. **Core Tables**
   - `essential_oils` âœ“ - Created with trigger for names_concatenated
   - `essential_oil_usage_suggestions` âœ“ - Created with proper RLS
   - `suggestion_health_issue_links` âœ“ - Created with proper RLS
   - `profiles` âœ“ - Updated with role and subscription fields

2. **Lookup Tables** (All with proper RLS policies)
   - `aromatic_descriptors` âœ“ - Created 
   - `categories` âœ“ - Created
   - `chemical_compounds` âœ“ - Created
   - `countries` âœ“ - Created 
   - `extraction_methods` âœ“ - Created
   - `health_issues` âœ“ - Created
   - `plant_parts` âœ“ - Created
   - `safety_characteristics` âœ“ - Created
   - `usage_modes` âœ“ - Created

3. **Junction Tables** (All with proper RLS policies)
   - `essential_oil_aromatic_descriptors` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_categories` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_chemical_compounds` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_extraction_countries` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_extraction_methods` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_plant_parts` âœ“ - Created
   - `essential_oil_safety` âœ“ - Created

## Recent Implementations (May 12, 2025)

### 1. User Role Management

Added role field and subscription-related columns to the profiles table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'::text CHECK (role IN ('user', 'premium', 'admin')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id text UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_status text,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_tier text,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_period text CHECK (subscription_period IN ('monthly', 'annual', NULL)),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_start_date timestamp with time zone,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_end_date timestamp with time zone;
```

### 2. Names Concatenation Trigger

Implemented a trigger for automatically populating the names_concatenated field:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_names_concatenated()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.names_concatenated = NEW.name_english || ' | ' || NEW.name_scientific || ' | ' || NEW.name_portuguese;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_names_concatenated
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.essential_oils
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_names_concatenated();
```

### 3. Row Level Security Policies

Implemented RLS policies for all tables following this pattern:
- Read access for everyone
- Write access (insert, update, delete) only for admin users

Example for essential_oils table:
```sql
-- Allow read access for all users (authenticated and anonymous)
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access for all users" ON public.essential_oils
    FOR SELECT
    USING (true);

-- Allow admin users to insert, update, and delete essential oils
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for admin users" ON public.essential_oils
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.uid() IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.profiles
        WHERE role = 'admin'
    ));
```

## Pending Tasks

### Database Verification & Completion

- [ðŸ”„] Verify all tables have the correct columns, constraints, and indexes
- [âœ“] Verify `names_concatenated` trigger for `essential_oils` table - IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] Check if the `embedding` field in `essential_oils` is properly configured
- [âœ“] Review all RLS (Row Level Security) policies for tables - IMPLEMENTED

### User Authentication & Roles

- [ ] Review existing authentication setup (using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth)
- [âœ“] Verify 'admin' role in profile table - IMPLEMENTED
- [âœ“] Implement RLS policies for admin access to essential oil management - IMPLEMENTED
- [âœ“] Ensure proper security for data modification operations - IMPLEMENTED

### Future Integration Tasks

- [ ] Create helper functions for database operations
- [ ] Set up admin-specific database functions if needed
- [ ] Create any necessary webhooks or triggers for automating processes

## Next Steps

1. Test the admin role functionality by assigning an admin role to at least one user
2. Test the `names_concatenated` trigger with sample data
3. Integrate the Supabase client with the frontend using @supabase/ssr
4. Implement any remaining helper functions
